# Challenges

These are problems delivered through [https://dailycodingproblem.com](https://dailycodingproblem.com).

[IFTTT](https://ift.tt) creates an issue from my email.  A subfolder is created for the issue containing:

- README.md:  description of the problem and a link to the issue
- solution.go:  a solution to the problem with a function called Solution()
- solution_test.go:  a test for the solution called TestSolution()

The solutions are my own, not official.
